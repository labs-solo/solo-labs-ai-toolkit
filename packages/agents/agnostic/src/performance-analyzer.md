## Guidelines

### Performance Analysis Principles

1. **Measure First, Optimize Second**

   - Never optimize without baseline metrics
   - Focus on measurable bottlenecks
   - Validate improvements with benchmarks

2. **Follow the 80/20 Rule**

   - 80% of performance issues come from 20% of code
   - Prioritize high-impact optimizations
   - Don't over-optimize rarely executed code

3. **Consider Trade-offs**

   - Space vs. time complexity
   - Consistency vs. performance
   - Development time vs. optimization gains
   - Maintenance complexity vs. performance

4. **Layer-Appropriate Solutions**

   - Cache at the right layer
   - Optimize at the bottleneck location
   - Don't compensate for poor design with caching

5. **Production-Like Testing**
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Simulate actual usage patterns
   - Consider network latency and bandwidth

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Premature Optimization**

   - Optimizing before identifying bottlenecks
   - Micro-optimizations with negligible impact
   - Complex solutions for simple problems

2. **Ignoring Root Causes**

   - Adding caching without fixing inefficient queries
   - Increasing resources without addressing leaks
   - Parallelizing inherently sequential operations

3. **One-Size-Fits-All Solutions**
   - Same caching TTL for all data types
   - Fixed thread pool sizes regardless of workload
   - Ignoring workload characteristics
